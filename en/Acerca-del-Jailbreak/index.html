<br><p><strong>What is the jailbreak? </strong></p>
<p>The jailbreak is the generic term that has been put to the methods that exist to bypass the security measures imposed by Apple on your iOS system and to be able to install, modify and change anything on the system. Different developers and teams have spent countless hours poring over Apple's software code to see where they could sneak in. </p>
<p>Sometimes it is easier and others it has cost a couple of versions, but finally there has always been a simple method to install as many applications as you want on the iPhone without having to stick only to the ones in the App Store. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br><p><strong>Is the jailbreak synonymous with piracy? </strong></p>
<p>No - but open the doors. We will try to make this point clear from the beginning. The mere fact of bringing the terminal with a jailbreak does not open the doors to the installation of pirated software. In fact, its creators seek the opposite. The proof is that if after jailbreaking a device you download an application and try to install it, the iPhone or iPad will not allow it. </p>
<p>Now, we are not going to be childish and deny the greatest. Doing the jailbreak does not allow you to install pirated applications, but it opens the door for anyone who wants to, at their own risk, do so. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br><p><strong>So what is the jailbreak for? </strong></p>
<p>The essence of jailbreaking the iPhone is to be able to modify the things that Apple does not allow. That is, further customize the system with different fonts, animations, new functions that are not in iOS, etc. </p>
<p> It is true that I was more right when in the beginning iOS was very limited and you could not do things like change the wallpaper or customize sounds, for example. From iOS 7 until iOS 14.4.2, the latest version released, Apple's software development has been tremendous and, as can be seen in different reports, many of its functions are inspired by tweaks and programs created under the jailbreak and that have ended up becoming standard features.</p>
<p>Still, Cydia, the quintessential software hub for jailbroken terminals, is packed with options that allow things like having multiple windows on the screen on an iPad, expanding bluetooth capabilities, and even transforming the entire look of the system. And as proof that it is not a "pirate's nest", the best and most successful ones are paid. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br><p><strong>Does jailbreak have dangers? </strong></p>
<p>No, it doesn't, at least for the integrity of the device and its systems. However, modifying Apple software may lead to the loss of the device warranty. It is difficult that in an Apple Store, and there are no known cases in which it has happened, if we have performed a restoration of the device from iTunes to the factory data it is noticed that it has been "jailbroken", but in theory, if it is discovered, the device may be denied warranty. </p>
